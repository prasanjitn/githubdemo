1) Steps For Configuring the GitHub

git config --global http.sslVerify false
 
>git config --global user.name "Your Name"  (Specifiy your github ID)
>git config --global user.email you@example.com  (Specify your github email ID registered one)


2) Create a New Folder

3) Pull the remote master branch if any from the repository.
e.g:

 git clone -b development https://github.com/---/---.git 
 
4)Check the branch by 
 
  >git branch  (it will show the master branch)

5)Create your own feature branch 
  Since,Making direct changes of modifying the master branch is not recommended 
i.e.
   git checkout -b branchname

6) Check again the branch by 
   >git branch > it should shows your current freature branch


7) Now you can add file/update an existing file.

8) Do update of existing file to start with by creating one issue e.g. update the READ ME FILE 

Execute the GIT Commit by > 

9)git commit -am "Updating the read me file closes issue#????"  
 (Find the -am value from internet, -a stand for addig the file )

10)Checking the differences
>git diff (to verify what difference you have added)

11) Then push the code to the REMOTE origin from where we got the original code, this will push your feature branch only as we don;t want to mess up the master branch 

12)> git push origin <YOUR FEATURE BRANCH NAME>

Execute the following to see if all code is in transferred or not

git status (this will show nothing to commit)


Then go to GITHUB WEBCONSOLE > Code > look for commits > Select your commit > Create a PULL req and associate the reviewer

Wait for the reviewer comment > Once confirmed then lets do the MERGE to the master.
